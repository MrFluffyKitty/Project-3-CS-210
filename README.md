# Project-3-CS-210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-This project was for showing how C++ and Python can link together to create a more efficient program. 
C++ works very well for user interfaces while Python is great with data processing, so using the two for their pros and reducing theirs cons always helps.
I found this project to give a great refresher on Python which I have not used recently, while also further cementing my foundation in C++.

What did you do particularly well?
-As I am still quite new to coding in general, I would not say I did particularly well with anything in this project but I do think I at least satified 
all the requested features adequately. It appears that I left an infinite loop in my histogram portion of the code, but it appears that the rest of the code ran well.
I think overall I excelled in meeting the specified requirements.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-As I stated above, I could definitely fix up the infinite loop in the histogram. Making the code completely correct would be great too. I am sure that even though I did 
not spot any other bugs in my code, I am sure their are plenty more that I overlooked.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
-I did not find anything particularly difficult to code in this project but I did have quite the time linking Python and C++ for the project. Other than that, it took
more than an hour to figure out that when I recieve a pymodule failed to return error code that there is a syntax error in my Python code. It seems obvious looking back
but for some reason I was not connecting the dots.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
-This project gave me the skills to confidently link files to code and use them to read/write on. It also taught me to completely read all the directions in the 
specification document. I would write a chuck of code then find out after completely reading the requirements that I needed to write that section in C++ or vice versa.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
-This project had many requirements and steps but they were many small parts that all connected together later. So, I basically just coded every individually and slowly
implemented them all together afterwards. I am not sure if this is the best technique for projects but this is the technique I went with.
